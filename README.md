## About‚ú®

Front-end developer with a passion for technology and experience in working in teams. I decided to fully dedicate myself to my career after interrupting medical school in Paraguay. I have excellent time management skills and the ability to learn quickly, as well as being collaborative and committed to achieving team goals. I constantly seek to improve my technical skills and to be updated with market trends.
